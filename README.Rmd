# pasagropasr: Datasets from the PAS-AGRO-PAS Project <a href='https://github.com/PAS-AGRO-PAS/pasagropasr/'><img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="138.5" /></a>

## Overview

The `pasagropasr` package provides a collection of datasets generated through the research activities of the PAS-AGRO-PAS project. These datasets are the result of collaborative work by all [PAS-AGRO-PAS partners](https://www.ipb.pt/pas-agro-pas/).  

The primary aim of this package is to make these datasets accessible to the research community, serving as a valuable resource for training young researchers and supporting studies in agriculture and environmental sciences.


## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of the package from CRAN (if available) or the development version from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install devtools package if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install the latest development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("PAS-AGRO-PAS/pasagropasr")
```

### Dataset Descriptions

The package currently includes the following dataset:

| Dataset       | Description                                                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lambBreeds`  | Data on lamb carcass measurements and tissue composition, categorized by breed. |

Additional datasets may be added in future versions to enhance the package's utility for agricultural and environmental research.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to get started with the `pasagropasr` package:

1. Install the package using CRAN or GitHub.
2. Load the package using `library(pasagropasr)`.
3. Load a dataset using the `data()` function.

Here is an example:

```{r}
# Load the package
library(pasagropasr)

# Load the dataset
data(lambBreeds)

# Explore the structure of the dataset
str(lambBreeds)
```

### Plot Example

Here is an example of a box plot showing the muscle content percentage by breed in the `lambBreeds` dataset:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

lambBreeds |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(
    aes(x = MUS, y = Breed), 
    colour = "#102C68", 
    fill = "#7AD151"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Muscle content (%)", 
    y = "Breed"
  )
```

## Requirements

`pasagropasr` requires R version 3.5 or higher. Additional suggested packages for extended functionality include:

- `ggplot2` for visualization.
- `readxl` for reading Excel files.
- `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization workflows.
